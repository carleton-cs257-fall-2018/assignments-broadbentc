Final Project
Charlie Broadbent and Eric Stadelman. We want to make the once famous Blackberry game Brick Breaker. We will give the user 3 lives and have progressively more difficult levels. In the Model class, we will deal with collisions, movement of the ball and paddle.


Our core classes:


* Model
   * Paddle  
   * Bricks  
   * Ball


* View class
   * Game board
   * Status View
      * Lives
      * Level
